# OpenIMDML - Open Instance Multi-Domain Motor Library
## Scope
The OpenIMDML is an open-source Modelica-based library that is focused on modeling and simulation of induction motor models in the phasor domain. It was built using the Modelica language, leveraging the Modelica Standard Library, and functions in conjunction with [OpenIPSL](https://github.com/OpenIPSL/OpenIPSL).
## OpenIMDML Library Structure
The library is structured into five sub-packages (illustrated in Figure shown below): Examples, NonMultiDomain, MultiDomain, Controls, and Functions.\

- **Examples:** contains Modelica model examples of all the components and models developed in the OpenIMDML Library. The Examples package contains three sub-packages, namely MultiDomainExamples, NonMultiDomainExamples, and BaseClasses. The MultiDomainExamples sub-package presents examples of the single-phase and three-phase multi-domain motor developed in the library, including motor validation examples, examples including a variable speed drive and its controls, and a simple example of a multi-domain motor interacting with a pump that fills up a reservoir. The NonMultiDomainExamples sub-package contains examples of single-phase and three-phase non multi-domain motor models from the library, including examples that incorporate the variable speed drive. The difference between multi-domain and non multi-domain is linked to the driven load representation. Lastly, the BaseClasses sub-package contains partial examples of examples that are utilized in more than one example.
- **NonMultiDomain:** contains single-phase and three-phase non multi-domain induction motor models. The NonMultiDomain package holds two sub-packages, namely SinglePhase, and ThreePhase. The SinglePhase sub-package presents two distinct motor models -- single-phase (SPIM) and dual-phase (DPIM) induction motor models. The SPIM motor is intended for cases when the motor is initialized in steady-state, while the DPIM motor can be used to simulate both start-up and steady-state initialization conditions. Both the SPIM and DPIM motor models are derived from *Electric machinery by Fitzgerald et al*. The ThreePhase sub-package accommodates five different motor models -- type I, type III, type V, CIM5, and CIM6. The first three are derived from PSAT (*An Open Source Power System Analysis Toolbox by Federico Milano*) while the latter two are derived from PSSE model manuals (*PSSE 34.2.0 Model Library*).
